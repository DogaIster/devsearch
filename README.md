## Inspiration
We didn't have a formal search engine for developers looking directly for repositories in GitHub. We thought it was a great idea to create a website that can search repositories directly from GitHub and show it to developers.

## What it does
It is a search engine for GitHub repositories, where you type the words in the text box and the page shows you all the repositories in GitHub that are related to your keyword

## How we built it
We used javascript for all the work.

## Challenges I ran into
We had trouble parsing information we got from the API

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We came up with an idea of what to work on quickly, so we could start work on it early. Also, we divided work for each team member and worked on them collaboratively

## What I learned
We learned more about designing/developing a website (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and about APIs. Also, we gained more experience with working on a challenging task in a limited time as a group.

## What's next for DevSearch
Our next goal for DevSearch is to expand this for other technical queries with a filtering system which only accepts the right codes verified by a certified developer.
